## 🧠 LLMs & RAG Systems

- Designing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines that blend vector search with LLMs to deliver precise, context-aware answers for real-world use cases.  
- Building **production-ready LLM agents** using frameworks like LangChain and local/cloud-hosted models, with a strong focus on reliability, observability, and prompt-engineering best practices.  
- Experimenting with embedding models, chunking strategies, and retrieval configurations to optimize latency, cost, and relevance for enterprise knowledge bases.

## 🕸️ Knowledge Graphs & GraphRAG

- Constructing **knowledge graphs** (including domain-focused graphs such as chemistry and materials) using Neo4j with clearly defined entities, relationships, and semantic structure.  
- Implementing **GraphRAG** by combining graph queries with vector search to enable reasoning over both structured and unstructured data in a single workflow.  
- Designing graph schemas and query patterns that make complex domain knowledge easily explorable for LLM agents and downstream analytics.

## 🧪 Data Extraction & Web Automation

- Developing robust **web scraping and automation** pipelines with tools like Selenium and browser-based agents to collect technical documents and structured data from the web.  
- Creating reusable components for PDF parsing, entity and relation extraction, and normalization of noisy raw data into clean, analysis-ready datasets.  
- Prioritizing reliability with strategies for handling dynamic pages, rate limits, captchas, and error recovery in long-running crawlers.

## 🗃️ Vector Databases & Semantic Search

- Working with **vector databases** (such as Milvus and similar systems) to power semantic search, similarity retrieval, and hybrid search (keyword + vector) applications.  
- Tuning indexing strategies, distance metrics, and filtering logic to balance recall, precision, and performance at scale.  
- Integrating vector stores into end-to-end applications, from data ingestion and embedding generation to query-time orchestration with LLMs.

## 🏗️ Production AI & Developer Workflow

- Prototyping and refining **AI-powered internal tools** for IT environments, including assistants for documentation, ticketing, and operational automation.  
- Using Docker, API-driven architectures, and modular Python code to make AI services easy to deploy, maintain, and integrate with existing systems.  
- Iterating in **Jupyter Notebooks** and **VS Code** with a strong emphasis on reproducibility, clean code structure, and collaborative development practices.
